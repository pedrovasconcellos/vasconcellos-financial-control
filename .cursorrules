# Cursor Rules

This file configures Cursor's AI agent behavior for this codebase. It complements and references AGENTS.md.

## Primary Reference

Always read and follow AGENTS.md for project-specific guidelines, architecture, and conventions.

## Key Principles

- Follow clean architecture: domain → use case → infrastructure/adapters
- Use UUID strings (`uuid.NewString()`) for all identifiers, never ObjectId
- Always create MongoDB indexes in repository constructors
- Ensure idempotency for all async operations
- Run tests before suggesting code: `go test ./...`, `npm run build`, `make lambda-build`

## When Making Changes

1. Check AGENTS.md for architecture patterns
2. Check BUGS_AND_LIMITATIONS.md for known issues to avoid
3. Check IMPROVEMENTS.md for planned enhancements
4. Run relevant tests before completing changes
5. Follow coding standards: Go in English, comments in Portuguese (when needed)

Reference: See AGENTS.md for complete guidelines.
